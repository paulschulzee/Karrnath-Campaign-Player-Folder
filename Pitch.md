## A Note on Looking Things Up
While I encourage you to read up on the setting of Eberron, please be careful about spoiling yourself on any of the many, many GM secrets strewn throughout exposition on it. ***In particular, please do not use the Eberron wiki on fandom.com.*** It is particularly liberal with including GM info in its articles, and I do not want you to spoil any major reveals or the like for yourself before the game even begins. If you intentionally seek out information on any of the factions or NPCs you encounter in-game in order to learn information that ought to be secret from your character, you may consider yourself banned from any of my tables for life.

## A Note on Character Concepts
Please refrain from "nailing down" anything about your character before we have our session 0. Pathfinder is a game in which party balance, for instance, matters a lot more than in D&D--if everyone brings a concept for a spellcaster to the table, someone will have to change. Additionally, if we all make characters together, then we will be able to figure out how all of you know each other (if at all), how your characters and their relationships interact with our theming, etc.

Alec is allowed to claim Necromancer as his character's class because he more or less learned the system in part motivated by its ability to express his character concept which is a fuck ton of work. Also because I landed on this campaign theme in part in response to his character concept.


## Concept
This campaign will be a sandbox investigative campaign. I'm hoping to tailor the content to the characters you create to make a player-driven experience that sprawls out in a tangled mess of intrigue. Will I succeed? Depends on how much work I put into prep, and I am very very lazy, so don't get your hopes *too* high. 

The main themes of the campaign will be undeath, political intrigue, religious conflict, and truth. You all will play as underdogs, people unwanted by any major society. Namely, undead and seekers (worshippers of the Blood of Vol). I expect your characters to be largely heroic, motivated by a strong sense of right and wrong (or at least a sense of *justice*) rather than personal gain. This campaign will be a story of your characters risking their lives to expose the truth in the face of institutions that hate them, and on behalf of a populous that may be only dubiously grateful. You will be the heroes Eberron needs, not the ones it wants.

### Eberron Overview
If you don't know anything about this setting, I encourage you to glance over the player copy of the Eberronicon! Our adventure will be limited to the continent of Khorvaire. The incredibly short summary is this:

- Ages ago, this guy named Galifar ir'Wynarn unified the whole continent under the Kingdom of Galifar. This was the 1st Year of the Kingdom (YK).
- Galifar had in it five nations: Breland, Aundair, Karrnath, Cyre, and Thrane, each ruled by a child of Galifar.
- About 100 years ago, in 894YK, King Jarot dies and his children squabble over who gets the throne. This "squabble" escalates into war, the Last War. The neat tidy sides of the beginning of the war quickly collapse as nations betray each other and form new alliances to try to come out on top.
- Several other nations declare independence during the war as minority groups and political sects see the opportunity to break away with less formidable opposition.
- The Dragonmarked Houses, organizations founded around bloodlines of humanoids with particular marks that give them extra abilities, profit immensely through neutrality. The war spurs innovation, and the Houses gain more and more power without a strong central government to keep them in check.
- In 994YK--four years ago, and exactly 100 years after the Last War started--Cyre is quickly and utterly destroyed in a magical catastrophe known as "the Mourning." A few groups of desperate refugees at the fringes of the country manage to survive, but the vast majority are killed.
- Fighting stops shortly thereafter, and soon the Treaty of Thronehold is signed by 12 nations. An unsteady peace pervades, for now.

See the Timeline in this document for more details.

Eberron is a world build around *pulp* and *noir.* I expect our campaign to vary between the two, depending on how action-y a particular investigation or area is. Eberron, or at least Khorvaire, is also quite a low-power world. Magic is utterly pervasive: maids use *prestidigitation* to help clean, chefs use it to cook, children learn *sigil* to tag buildings with temporary magical graffiti, etc. However, it is *low-level.* Any spell of ranks 2-3 is uncommon, ranks 4-5 is rare, and rank 6+ is legendary--having the "unique" tag. Instead of technological advancement, Eberron has magical advancement--railways powered by trapped lightning elementals, massive wands used as cannons, men of wood and steel animated by raw magical force, etc. 

### Religions in Eberron
Religious conflict will be a theme of the campaign, so before the other background it's necessary to explain some of the religions in play. (Take a look at the "faiths" chapter in the Eberronicon for more information). Of note is that gods themselves are not present on Eberron, even though their worshippers can cast divine magic--which is generally considered more miraculous and strange than the well-known science of arcane magic.

The Sovereign Host are the most widely-recognized deities on Eberron. Eons ago, 13 champions fought against the demonic overlords ruling Eberron, succeeding at ending the age of demons and ascending to godhood. 4 have since been cast out, and the rest form the pantheon of the sovereign host. Vassals, worshippers of the sovereign host, tend to worship the entire pantheon, although clerics will sometimes focus on one god (while still giving reverence to all). Worship of the Sovereign Host is diverse, and vassals tend to be tolerant of others.

The Dark Six are like the evil Sovereign Host. Four of them are the champions that got cast out of the Sovereign Host. Vassals of the host still sometimes pray to them in a "please don't fuck me up, just leave me alone" kinda way.

The Silver Flame arose after the Couatls--a race of winged serpents--sacrificed themselves to bind the aforementioned demonic overlords. Later, a Thranish paladin named Tira Miron sacrificed herself to renew the bindings on the overlord Bel Shalor, causing a silver flame to appear where she died. On that flame was founded the city of Flamekeep, and the Church of the Silver Flame was born. During the last war, the Church slowly took over control of Thrane, and now Thrane is a theocracy under the Church. The Church believes in eating your vegetables, going to bed on time, and even crossing national lines to defend innocents from supernatural horrors like demons, aberrations from Khyber, and undead. Yes, undead. Uh oh.

The Blood of Vol are turbo-atheists (as opposed to regular atheists, which do exist on Eberron!). Followers of the Blood of Vol are called seekers of the divinity within, or just "seekers." Seekers believe that if gods exist, they are cruel. Rather, true divine power is in the blood, and the project of the seeker is to perfect that power and live their one precious life to the fullest. Seekers place heavy emphasis on community and collective struggle, as well as making the most of your life. Seekers think that once you're dead, you're gone, and so have no issue with their body being used however is practical after they are dead--they are excellent necromancers. Some champions of the Blood of Vol become undead, which outsiders sometimes misinterpret as meaning seekers worship undead--in reality, seekers view becoming undead as a great sacrifice, a process undertaken by champions that cuts them off from their own divine spark so that they may continue to teach and guide new generations. 

### Karrnath
Most of the campaign will take place in Karrnath. Karrnath was one of the "five nations" that composed the Kingdom of Galifar before the Last War broke out. Karrnath is known for its intense martial discipline, and its use of undead soldiers during the Last War. Its monarch, King Kaius ir'Wynarn III, was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold, which ended the Last War. That was four years ago, in 994 YK--994 years after the founding of the Kingdom of Galifar. Today is 998YK.

King Kaius I made a deal with Seekers during the last war in exchange for undead troops, but seekers have never been a religious majority in Karrnath--vassals were and are the majority. More recently, King Kaius III and Regent Moranna have turned on the Blood of Vol. The seeker knight orders were disbanded, and King Kaius III publicly blames the Blood of Vol for the famines and plagues that crippled Karrnath's military to the point where they had to rely on undead soldiers in the first place. 

Karrnath, right now, is a powder keg. The threat and mystery of the Mourning looms over the continent of Khorvaire, but the tensions of the Last War were never really resolved. The Code of Kaius, implemented by Kaius ir'Wynarn I during the Last War, is still in place, placing strict rationing and harsh punishments on the citizens of Karrnath--generally with their approval. The Sovereign Host is most commonly worshipped in Karrnath, but the Blood of Vol still has its devotees in communities that use skeletons and zombies for labor. Many seekers credit Karrnath's use of undead soldiers with rescuing its prospects in the Last War, and some believe that Karrnath would have won the war if it had continued. These believers, including many powerful generals, tend to resent Kaius for signing the Treaty of Thronehold and ending the war. Traditionalists, however, follow the Sovereign Host--more conservative Traditionalists blame the dark magic of the Blood of Vol for the famines and plagues that necessitated Karrnath's pivot to undead soldiers in the first place. 

Thrane, Karrnath's western neighbor, is a theocracy run by the Church of the Silver Flame, which believes that undead, by their very existence, suck the life force out of the world. This, combined with the history of bloody conflict on the Thrane-Karrnath border (Shadukar, for instance, was totally destroyed by Karrnathi forces and has yet to be reclaimed), has lead to enormous tension between the two countries. Things are complicated further by a string of terrorist attacks committed by the Order of the Emerald Claw, a terrorist organization affiliated with the Blood of Vol that claims to want to restore Karrnath to its former glory. If Karrnath doesn't demonstrate that they are trying everything in their power to stop the attacks, there's no telling what Thrane will do in response.

### Atur
You all begin play in the city of Atur, in Karrnath. Atur is in a manifest zone of Mabar, the plane of negative energy, and so necromancy is much more powerful there. The vast majority of the undead that fought for Karrnath in the Last War were animated in Atur, and it's still common to see skeleton laborers on the streets. The town is lit by lamps powered by shards of bone--the same electroplasmic force that animates skeletons glows a soft green under the right conditions. Expectedly, Atur is a stronghold of the Blood of Vol, and in the center the large Crimson Monastery--a massive pyramid of red brick--is the largest place of worship dedicated to the Blood of Vol. Underneath the city are the Vaults of the Dead, where the undead soldiers of the last war lie in suspended animation, just in case.

Atur is a nocturnal city. Quiet as a tomb during the day, at night the city bustles with life--it is known as a tourist location for its vivid party culture and tolerance of activities that may be unsavory elsewhere. This partying isn't just for fun--the energy of the city at night, the exuberance, the *life,* helps to counteract the deleterious effects the Mabaran manifest zone would normally have on the living denizens.

Atur will be one of the few places your characters are accepted, and one of the few places where your characters are celebrated when news of their good deeds comes.

### Your Character
Your character, in keeping with our theme, should be an undead, a seeker, both, or for some other reason the sort of general outcast that would fit in with the party. No matter what class you play, consider your character's religion, their philosophy, their convictions, and their bonds to the life they live.

## Characters
We will be using the [Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/2qF7WjsY-pathfinders-guide-to-eberron) to play an Eberron game in Pathfinder. The Pathfinder's guide has not been updated for the remaster, so there are still some things like alignment that will need to be adapted on a case-by-case basis. If you have any questions at all, ask me. We will begin play at **level 4**.

We will be playing with three custom character creation rules. The first is [free archetype](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2751), which gives you an additional feat at every even level that you can only use on archetype feats. Normally, you would have to forgo a class feat to take an archetype feat, but free archetype renders this unnecessary. However, there is the restriction that *your free archetype must be on theme.* This obviously includes any of the undead archetypes (so that you can make an undead character)--anything else, ask me. If you'd like to play a dragonmarked character, the Dragonmarked Scion archetype could work well, depending on the dragonmark. 

The second custom rule is that everyone trained in the medicine skill gets the [stitch flesh](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=3495) skill feat for free, allowing them to use Treat Wounds on undead creatures. In an undead campaign this would just be a feat tax to not give out. 

The third custom rule is [Automatic Bonus Progression](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2741&Redirected=1). We'll be playing loosely with this rule, making obvious exceptions in obvious cases--for instance, Kineticists do *not,* strictly RAW, get to apply attack potency to any of their abilities, but that's clearly silly and so they will be allowed to do so. This rule disproportionately helps martials, as it saves them a lot of money on magic weapons--consider this when distributing loot, and I will do my best to supply spellcasters with staves, wands, and scrolls to compensate. I like this rule because it emphasizes the heroic nature of your *characters,* and also fits better for a campaign where I expect you to be motivated more by your sense of justice than by sick loot.

### Ancestries
Karrnath is primarily human, dwarf, halfling, half-elf, and elf. Skeletons are also obviously allowed. Please talk to me before using any of the other ancestries in the Pathfinder's Guide, and if something doesn't appear in the Pathfinder's guide the answer is almost certainly "no." 

Kalashtar could interact well with themes of positive/negative energy and such. Shifters suffered immensely during the Church of the Silver Flame's lycanthrope purges, and so could have unique feelings towards Thrane. You could create a unique Warforged with a void-aligned soul, being the world's only undead Warforged. There are possibilities here.

If you are playing as an undead, it's up to you how much of your previous life you remember. Just remember that sentient zombies and skeletons are *not normal.* You might play as a powerful undead sorcerer that died on the front lines of the Last War and managed to cling to their sentience (and magical ability) when they were reanimated through a complicated arcane process. Alternatively, you might be a secret Aturan experiment, brought back to life to accomplish some task. Vampires and Mummies also exist in Atur. Mummies are notably called "Oathbound," for the obvious reason that they are bound by an oath and their existence will cease if they violate it.

If you'd like to play a dragonmarked character, the mark of the Sentinel appears on humans of the Deneith bloodline, which originates in Karrnath. House Deneith is primarily interested in personal protection, although it also offers some military services. You might even be a Sentinel Marshal, empowered by the Treaty of Thronehold to enforce the law wherever you are---then you have a natural buy-in to the campaign.

You might instead be an Elf with the mark of shadow, under House Thuranni (or not). House Thuranni primarily operates entertainment businesses and such. Definitely nothing else. Ignore that it's called the mark of shadow. Nope. Nothing suspicious.

Dragonmarks do not work on undead. Rather, they haven't worked on undead before the start of the campaign--if you want your character to be the first dragonmarked undead, let's talk.

Feel free to pitch any other mark to me, but you'd have to explain how you fit in with the party and campaign and why you're in Atur. 

### Backgrounds
If you can't find a background that you think works for you, I'm happy to create a custom one for you. Any common background from a core book (not an adventure path) is also fine. The Excoriate (only 2 attribute boosts), House Orphan, and House Scion backgrounds are also appropriate for dragonmarked characters.

The Last War ended four years ago. Unless you're a warforged, that means you were alive for a lot of it. Think about what your character was doing, what their relationship to the military was, what their thoughts about the undead soldiers were, etc. I suppose if you're undead you might not remember it--or you might still think it's going on when you're animated or awoken at the start of the campaign. How long have you been awake/animated? Etc.

I will reiterate here that you should think about your character's faith, philosophy, political allegiances, and sense of justice. What drives them, ideologically, and what do they think is possible pragmatically? Who is important to your character? Where is their home? Etc.

### Classes 
Any class options that are particularly tied to undeath will be fantastic in this game. This includes bones oracles, undead eidolon summoners, undead bloodline sorcerers, spirit instinct barbarians, etc. 

I've described this as an "investigative" campaign, so it'll be no surprise that an Investigator would of course also be a great choice--a reflavored Forensic Medicine Investigator could be super fun. Rogue would also work well as a skill monkey. Clerics and Champions are also bound up in faith and religiosity, which obviously work well. 

Class archetypes are special subclasses that alter a class more than usual. You select them at 1st level, and you must take the dedication at 2nd level. The class archetype then functions like a normal archetype, giving you feats you can take in your free archetype slot or in place of your normal class feats. 

Some class archetypes deserve special mention for appropriateness: the [Avenger](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=282) is a religious Rogue, and the [Vindicator](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=285) is a religious Ranger. (We can talk about changing the Blood of Vol's favored weapon for Avengers and about letting Vindicators take a different hunter's edge). The [Battle Harbinger](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/archetypes/battle-harbinger-rm) archetype for Cleric is basically an even more weapon focused Cleric, and I mention it mostly because it's not yet on Archives of Nethys. The [Bloodrager](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=283) Barbarian is a Barbarian that draws on the power of blood to cast spells while raging, which is obviously *amazing* for a Blood of Vol character. 

The playtest [Runesmith](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/classes/runesmith-playtest?srsltid=AfmBOooofiEdIAGJ7xvjm8K3My5kpRF2Nw3ymHzAasZQpD4g6QeDs7JU) could work as an Artificer analogue, if you're particularly interested. It will require some reflavoring. The Necromancer *will* work beautifully--Alec has had dibs on it for a while now. 

The Pathfinder's Guide has a reflavoring for the Gunslinger that relies on Siberys powder that I... don't like, and feels like it just introduces guns to the game. I would much prefer to reflavor a gunslinger as a wandslinger, who reloads by swapping to another wand or recharging it with a short cantrip. The Pathfinder's Guide also has the *Wandslinger* class archetype, which looks... really, really bad to me, and is also super super confusing. If you *really* want to use that, maybe we can go for it, but I suspect you'd be better off reflavoring a normal Gunslinger with a casting archetype.

Devout champions of the Blood of Vol (or potentially other classes) could be Bone Knights, a warrior who has been fused with their armor. Their armor, in turn, has been decorated with the bones of their enemies. The bone armor is supposed to give them better powers to control undead, and they served as Karrnathi generals during the Last War. Nowadays they have varying allegiances. Perhaps you even served with the Order of the Onyx Skull, one of the former seeker knight orders of Karrnath. How do you feel about the country you swore to protect betraying you?

See more ideas on how to fit various classes into Eberron in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1d2y4zw/running_pathfinder2e_in_eberron_a_short_guide_to/). Below is a table of how well I think various classes would work. "Not Recommended" isn't "banned," if you have a good character concept to go along with any of those classes--a Cleric of the Silver Flame with the [splinter faith](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1173) feat could be interesting, for example.

| Status               | Classes                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strongly Recommended | Undead subclasses, Cleric (Blood of Vol), Champion (Blood of Vol), Barbarian (Bloodrager) |
| Recommended          | Investigator, Rogue, Ranger (Vindicator)                                                  |
| Appropriate          | Other common classes (except below), Runesmith (Playtest)                                 |
| Not Recommended      | Cleric (Silver Flame), Champion (Silver Flame), Druid, Inventor, Animist, Exemplar        |

### Archetypes
As stated before, [undead archetypes](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?Category=8) are largely appropriate. I'll call out Zombie and Vampire as particularly appropriate--Oathbound (mummies) can't usually leave Atur, but perhaps you're an exception. I'm... on the fence about ghosts, it feels a bit... goofy? And I feel like describing combat would be... hard. Ghouls... idk what's going on with ghouls in Eberron, but I'm pretty sure they at least weren't reanimated by Karrnath, so you probably got ghoul fever some other way and then found your way to Atur.

Class archetypes mentioned above are considered "on-theme" and can have their feats in the free archetype slot. 

When selecting your archetype, I will ask you to bear balance among party members in mind. Free archetype is wonky in that some archetypes are mostly flavor (i.e. not very powerful) and some are, well, intended to be taken in place of class feats and so are as powerful as class feats. If you're exclusively taking archetype feats that are as powerful as class feats you're likely going to be ahead of your peers. I'm not asking you to intentionally nerf yourself, but rather to choose an archetype that seems fun and flavorful and inspires you, and to not worry about power to much. 

(Most multiclass archetypes will be rejected along grounds like this, that a free archetype character who takes a multiclass archetype is effectively getting twice as many class feats whereas one who takes an undead archetype is getting a few cool, flavorful abilities).

I'll reiterate here that the Dragonmarked Scion archetype from the Pathfinder's Guide could work well (although I haven't read through it so maybe it sucks or is broken). [Blessed One](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=242) could represent the divinity within well--it's known to be one of the most powerful archetypes in the game, but its abilities are mostly around healing and helping allies so I don't mind as much. The "[Edgewatch Detective](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=85)" archetype is supposed to be setting-specific, but is general enough to function as just a normal detective (although we may have to do something else in place of "sense alignment").

Look through all the archetypes [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx).

### Arcs
Inspired by other games I'm playing now (*Slugblaster* and *Old Gods of Appalachia*), I'm going to ask you to design an *arc* for your character. The arc should take the form of a vague series of beats that drives your character towards a certain goal. For instance, if your character's arc was finding and bringing to justice the person who killed you, your arc *might* look like this:
- Introductory scene: Flashback to my death, explain my goal to the party
- Step: Find out who I was in life
- Step: Find out who killed me
- Step: Find out *why* they killed me
- Step: Find out where they are
- Resolution: Confront them, and either kill them or spare them
- Conclusion: Reflecting on whether I feel any better after this whole thing

Try to keep your arcs this length or shorter, given how little time we have in the semester. Each time you accomplish one of the scenes in your arc, the party will gain a nice little package of bonus xp (I haven't decided how much--somewhere in the 200-300 xp range, probably, depending how much xp you get from other sources. Introductions and conclusions will give the least, steps in the middle, and the resolution the most).

I'm hoping that these player arcs can drive a lot of the action, hence why I'm incentivizing you to accomplish them. At first I figured only the person whose arc it was would get xp, but I think for steps and resolution at least the whole party will get xp so that y'all are encouraged to support each other and be a fan of each other's characters. That said, don't be [that guy](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ozVtq4urP3k).

I'd advise you to keep these steps vague--I don't want you to feel like you know exactly what will happen to your character, only what the main beats of the story will be like if you're successful. If something big happens, you can always edit your arc later (with my permission).

Given how short this semester is, I think it would make sense to start your characters with some sort of direction towards accomplishing their arcs. Maybe in the example above you begin the game by waking up in the Vault of the Dead, only hazy memories of your past, clutching a set of Thranish dog tags that have had the name long since weathered off, leaving only the letters "R____ Sl___". Something like that. I'll determine your "starting clues" once you've decided on your arc.

Arcs can be anything. Maybe you want to re-found the Onyx Skull as an organization for good. Maybe you want to convince the Church of the Silver Flame that not all undead are bad, to ease tensions between Karrnath and Thrane. Maybe you want to figure out who's at the head of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Maybe you want to go pick some rare herbs. Idk. They will obviously be better if they somehow involve the themes of religion, politics, undeath, and acts of heroism in the face of systems that despise you, but the best arc will be one that you will love playing through the whole semester.

## Background Info & Further Reading
See the "Eberronicon" in this folder, although note that *your character almost certainly does not know all of the information in the Eberronicon.* They certainly know information relevant to themselves, but they might not really have much of an idea of what the Shadow Marches are like other than "loose tribes of Humans and Orcs."
