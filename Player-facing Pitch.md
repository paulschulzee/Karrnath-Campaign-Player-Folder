Okay, about to push, I'm not going to mess it up this time.

## A Note on Looking Things Up
While I encourage you to read up on the setting of Eberron, please be careful about spoiling yourself on any of the many, many GM secrets strewn throughout exposition on it. ***In particular, please do not use the Eberron wiki on fandom.com.*** It is particularly liberal with including GM info in its articles, and I do not want you to spoil any major reveals or the like for yourself before the game even begins. If you intentionally seek out information on any of the factions or NPCs you encounter in-game in order to learn information that ought to be secret from your character, you may consider yourself banned from any of my tables for life.

## A Note on Character Concepts
Please refrain from "nailing down" anything about your character before we have our session 0. Pathfinder is a game in which party balance, for instance, matters a lot more than in D&D--if everyone brings a concept for a spellcaster to the table, someone will have to change. Additionally, if we all make characters together, then we will be able to figure out how all of you know each other (if at all), how your characters and their relationships interact with our theming, etc.

Alec is allowed to claim Necromancer as his character's class because he more or less learned the system in part motivated by its ability to express his character concept which is a fuck ton of work. Also because I landed on this campaign theme in part in response to his character concept.

## Concept
This campaign will be an investigative campaign designed largely around the theme of undeath. You all will begin play as agents of Karrnath, one of the "five nations" that composed the Kingdom of Galifar before the Last War broke out. Karrnath is known for its intense martial discipline, and its use of undead soldiers during the Last War. Its monarch, King Kaius ir'Wynarn III, was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold, which ended the Last War. That was four years ago, in 994YK--994 years after the founding of the Kingdom of Galifar. Today is 998YK.   

Two things are true about your character. First, you have some connection to undeath. Perhaps you yourself are undead--and extraordinary in your undeath, if you are a zombie or skeleton, given those are typically mindless servants in Karrnath. Perhaps you are an oracle, sorcerer, or summoner who draws their power from Mabadar, the negative energy plane of Eberron. Perhaps you are a Champion or Cleric of the Blood of Vol, the religious sect that pioneered Karrnath's use of undead during the Last War. Or perhaps you are any other class and ancestry of character with strong beliefs about the nature of life, death, and undeath. Second, your character has been contracted by the kingdom of Karrnath for a dangerous investigation. Perhaps you are a highly accomplished lead inspector for a city guard. Perhaps you are a sentient zombie, created as an experiment during the Last War and put into a kind of not-quite-dead stasis after the Mourning. Perhaps your brother is an accomplished statesman and gave you the role because he knew you were unemployed and liable to get into trouble.

Karrnath, right now, is a powder keg. The threat and mystery of the Mourning looms over the continent of Khorvaire, but the tensions of the Last War were never really resolved. The Code of Kaius, implemented by Kaius ir'Wynarn I during the Last War, is still in place, placing strict rationing and harsh punishments on the citizens of Karrnath--generally with their approval. The Sovereign Host is most commonly worshipped in Karrnath, but the Blood of Vol still has its devotees in communities that use skeletons and zombies for labor. Worshippers of the Blood of Vol are called *seekers,* short for "seekers of the divinity within." Many seekers credit Karrnath's use of undead soldiers with rescuing its prospects in the Last War, and some believe that Karrnath would have won the war if it had continued. These believers, including many powerful generals, tend to resent Kaius for signing the Treaty of Thronehold and ending the war. Traditionalists, however, follow the Sovereign Host--more conservative Traditionalists blame the dark magic of the Blood of Vol for the famines and plagues that necessitated Karrnath's pivot to undead soldiers in the first place. 

Thrane, Karrnath's western neighbor, is a theocracy run by the Church of the Silver Flame, which believes that undead, by their very existence, suck the life force out of the world. This, combined with the history of bloody conflict on the Thrane-Karrnath border (Shadukar, for instance, was totally destroyed by Karrnathi forces and has yet to be reclaimed), has lead to enormous tension between the two countries. Things are complicated further by a string of terrorist attacks committed by the Order of the Emerald Claw, a terrorist organization affiliated with the Blood of Vol that claims to want to restore Karrnath to its former glory. If Karrnath doesn't demonstrate that they are trying everything in their power to stop the attacks, there's no telling what Thrane will do in response.

This is where you come in. You, for some reason or another, have been contracted by the government to get to the bottom of who's commanding the Order of the Emerald Claw and put a stop to them. Along the way, you may have to deal with Thranish priests and paladins, devout seekers in Karrnathi politics, rabid Karrnathi traditionalists that hate you for your wicked magic, and, let's not forget, terrorists intent on igniting the flame of war. You begin play at level 4, already exceptional, and will reach level 8 or 9, among the most powerful humanoids on Khorvaire. 

## Characters
We will be using the [Pathfinder's Guide to Eberron](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/2qF7WjsY-pathfinders-guide-to-eberron) to play an Eberron game in Pathfinder. The Pathfinder's guide has not been updated for the remaster, so there are still some things like alignment that will need to be adapted on a case-by-case basis. If you have any questions at all, ask me.

We will be playing with two custom character creation rules. The first is *free archetype,* which gives you an additional feat at every even level that you can only use on archetype feats. Normally, you would have to forgo a class feat to take an archetype feat, but free archetype renders this unnecessary. However, there is the restriction that *your free archetype must be on theme.* This obviously includes any of the undead archetypes (so that you can make an undead character)--anything else, ask me. If you'd like to play a dragonmarked character, the Dragonmarked Scion archetype could work well, depending on the dragonmark. 

The second custom rule is that everyone trained in the medicine skill gets the [stitch flesh](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=3495) skill feat for free, allowing them to use Treat Wounds on undead creatures. In an undead campaign this would just be a feat tax to not give out. 

### Ancestries
Karrnath is primarily human, dwarf, halfling, half-elf, and elf. Skeletons are also obviously allowed. Please talk to me before using any of the other ancestries in the Pathfinder's Guide, and if something doesn't appear in the Pathfinder's guide the answer is almost certainly "no." 

Kalashtar could interact well with themes of positive/negative energy and such. Shifters were the victim of a genocide at the hands of the Church of the Silver Flame, and so could have unique feelings towards Thrane. You could create a unique Warforged with a void-aligned soul, being the world's only undead Warforged. There are possibilities here.

If you are playing as an undead, it's up to you how much of your previous life you remember. Just remember that sentient zombies and skeletons are *not normal.* You might play as a powerful undead sorcerer that died on the front lines of the Last War and managed to cling to their sentience (and magical ability) when they were reanimated through a complicated arcane process. Alternatively you might be a secret Karrnathi experiment, finally brough back to undeath in a moment of desperation--in this case you might have *no* memory (or only fleeting memory) of what you were before.

If you'd like to play a dragonmarked character, the mark of the Sentinel appears on humans of the Deneith bloodline, which originates in Karrnath. House Deneith is primarily interested in personal protection, although it also offers some military services. It is *incredibly* neutral, so be aware of that if you consider a character from House Deneith---Karrnath would have to be paying you. You might even be a Sentinel Marshal, empowered by the Treaty of Thronehold to enforce the law wherever you are---then you have a natural buy-in to the campaign.

You might instead be an Elf with the mark of shadow, under House Thuranni (or not). House Thuranni primarily operates entertainment businesses and such. Definitely nothing else. Ignore that it's called the mark of shadow. Nope. Nothing suspicious.

### Backgrounds
If you can't find a background that you think works for you, I'm happy to create a custom one for you. Any common background from a core book (not an adventure path) is also fine.

The Last War ended four years ago. Unless you're a warforged, that means you were alive for a lot of it. Think about what your character was doing, what their relationship to the military was, what their thoughts about the undead soldiers were, etc.

Think also about your character's faith. Gods are not present on Eberron, so they might be passively secular in the way many Americans are nowadays--if so, think about why they haven't been attracted to any of the religions on Eberron. The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith in Karrnath, but the Blood of Vol still has a large following. Some believe the Blood of Vol and undead troops saved Karrnath, and some believe that Karrnath's use of undead is what lead to plagues, famines, and the like. 

### Classes 
Any class options that are particularly tied to undeath will be fantastic in this game. This includes bones oracles, undead eidolon summoners, undead bloodline sorcerers, spirit instinct barbarians, etc. 

I've described this as an "investigative" campaign, so it'll be no surprise that an Investigator would of course also be a great choice--a reflavored Forensic Medicine Investigator could be super fun. Rogue would also work well as a skill monkey, and a Ranger who leans more into the bounty hunting side of things. The [Avenger](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/archetypes/avenger) and [Vindicator](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/archetypes/vindicator) class archetypes, for Rogue and Ranger respectively (not on Archives of Nethys), deserve special mention as possibilities. Clerics and Champions are also bound up in faith and religiosity, which could be very interesting. The [Battle Harbinger](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/archetypes/battle-harbinger-rm) archetype for Cleric could work as well.

The playtest [Runesmith](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/classes/runesmith-playtest?srsltid=AfmBOooofiEdIAGJ7xvjm8K3My5kpRF2Nw3ymHzAasZQpD4g6QeDs7JU) could work as an Artificer analogue, if you're particularly interested. It will require some reflavoring. The Necromancer *will* work beautifully--Alec has had dibs on it for a while now. 

Devout champions of the Blood of Vol (or potentially other classes) could be a Bone Knight, a warrior who has been fused with their armor. Their armor, in turn, has been decorated with the bones of their enemies. The bone armor is supposed to give them better powers to control undead, and they served as Karrnathi generals during the Last War. Nowadays they have varying allegiances.

## Background Info & Further Reading
See the "Eberronicon" in the Google Drive folder, although note that *your character almost certainly does not know all of the infomration in the Eberronicon.* They certainly know information relevant to themselves, but they might not really have much of an idea of what the Shadow Marches are like other than "loose tribes of Humans and Orcs."
