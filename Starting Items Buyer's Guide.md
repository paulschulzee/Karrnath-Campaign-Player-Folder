## Bulk, Encumbrance, Etc.
You can view the full rules [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2153), but weight in pathfinder is measured in the abstract unit "bulk." You can easily carry a number of bulk equal to 5 + STR. Very small items are *negligible,* meaning you don't have to care about them at all. Small items like a candle are *light*---10 light items is 1 bulk. (Always round down---9 light items is 0 bulk, and 19 light items is 1 bulk.) Items you can hold in one hand, like a longsword, are 1 bulk, and bulkier (heh) things are more. 

If you wear a backpack, it doesn't count against your bulk limit. You can carry 4 bulk in your backpack--the first 2 bulk of that doesn't count against you. So if you are wearing a backpack with 3 bulk of items, and wearing a healer's kit with bulk 1, you count as carrying 2 bulk. Anything in your backpack is harder to reach, which is why in official pathfinder art the characters are always wearing 3 bazillion harnesses and doodads and things.

## Kits
Every class has a premade "kit" of stuff you can buy at 1st level (so costing less than 15 gp). Simply go to your class' entry on Archives of Nethys and click on the "___ kits" section along the top. For instance, the Sorcerer kit can be found [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/ClassKits.aspx?Class=62).

The classic [Adventurer's Pack](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2700) is available, if you think you might need to camp somewhere. 

## Spellcasting Stuff
If you are a spellcaster, there are two main types of item that you want to buy: wands and staves. Scrolls can supplement as consumables. If you have the Trick Magic Item feat, you can work with wands and scrolls.

### Wands
You can use a wand once per day to cast a certain spell from your spell list. You needn't know the spell. You can use a wand a second time in the same day, but it breaks--and there's a 50% chance it's permanently broken, so do so sparingly.

You can find the whole list of wands [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=34), but almost certainly you'll want to purchase the generic "[magic wand](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3050)," which has no extra effects and just lets you cast a 1st-rank spell once per day. A 1st-rank magic wand costs 60 gp. 

Wands are good for spells that you will get use out of every day, but probably not more than once per day.

#### Good Spells for Wands
##### Divine
- [Mystic Armor](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1611) (mage armor) is +1 AC
- [Restyle](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=984) (lol)
- Maybe [Alarm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1439)?
- [Enfeeble](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1513), since it really only works on STR-based creatures

### Staves
Staves are... [complicated](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=3211), but the basic fact is that each staff has a certain number of spells in it. You can cast cantrips from your staff freely. At the start of the day, the staff gains a number of charges equal to your highest-ranked spell slot--so, 2 in our case. You can then spend X charges to cast an Xth level spell from the staff. You can only do this if the spell is on your spell list.

Staves are somewhat limited and very expensive at 4th level, so they're not *essential,* but you can take a look at the list [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=32) if you'd like. I'll point out the [staff of healing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3042) and [Nyctessa's Staff](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2779) for our sorcerer.

You can also craft your own staff, but it's expensive and you have to supply a casting of all the spells you want on the staff and you need to be good at crafting... we'll figure that out later if you're interested.

### Scrolls
Just like D&D, scrolls are one-time use castings of a spell. Great for utility spells you might need "at some point." Just remember that pulling an item out is an action, so if the scroll isn't in your hand at the start of combat it might be cumbersome to pull out.

Scrolls are also available earlier than ones. A 2nd-rank wand is a level 5 item, so you don't have access, but a 2nd-rank scroll is a level 3 item, so you can buy them just fine. See prices [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2962)--rank 1 scrolls are a measly 4gp! Pick up, say, Mending, and if it ever comes in handy you'll be *real glad* you did, and if it doesn't, who cares, you only spent 4 gp on it anyways.

#### Good Spells for Scrolls
##### Divine
Rank 1
- Alarm
- Breadcrumbs
- Detect Poison
- Helpful Steps (make a ladder)
- Lock
- Mending
- Quick Sort
- Synchronize
Rank 2
- Ventriloquism (heightened)
- Augury
- Create Food
- Dispel Magic
- Mimic Undead
- Status
- Translate
- Water Breathing/Walk

## Martial Stuff
### Runes
Weapon property runes modify your weapon in some way, and you can etch one onto one of your weapons. The full list is [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=23&Subcategory=27)--remember you can only purchase things level 4 or less at this time, so your rune options are pretty limited, but Fanged lets you turn into a wolf, Merciful lets you not kill people, and Authorized makes it so that only you can use your weapon.

## Consumables, Etc.
### Talismans and Spellhearts
[Talismans](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=15&Subcategory=19) are consumable items you attach to your weapons or armor, and can then activate once before they burn out. It takes 10 minutes to affix a talisman, and you can only have 1 talisman per weapon or armor at a time. Some examples:
- [Emergency Disguise](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=862)
- [Monkey Pin](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2985) (makes you really good at climbing for a turn)
- [Merciful Charm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1523) (makes your weapon nonlethal for a minute) 
- [Retrieval Prism](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1032) (teleport a predetermined item into your hand as a free action)

[Spellhearts](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=68) are reusable talismans, and usually let you cast some sort of spell when affixed. You can only have one spellheart or one talisman on a weapon or armor, not both. 

You can only cast a spell from a spellheart *if you have the spellcasting class feature.* You can notably use your spell DC or attack modifier in place of the item's, so if you're a spellcaster it's a great way to nab an extra cantrip.
- [Jolt Coil](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2231) (grants *electric arc,* a reflex save and generally considered one of the best damaging cantrips)

### Potions
One action to pull out, one action to imbibe. Best used pre-combat. Full list [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=15&Subcategory=18).
- [Healing Potion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2943) (Lesser)
- [Oil of Unlife](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2938) (not technically a potion, but healing potion for undead ppl)

### Oils
Spread 'em on your weapons. Full list [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=15&Subcategory=17). 
- [Merciful Balm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2072) (make a weapon nonlethal for an hour)
- [Serpent Oil](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2076)

## Misc
If you're bored, take a look at the [worn items](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=41).

There are three bazillion [Aeon Stones](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3055&Redirected=1) to choose from, that orbit your head and give you an effect of some kind. The *dusty rose prism* lets you cast *shield* for free, which is great. The *pearly white spindle* heals you 1 hp / minute. Or buy a *consumed Aeon Stone* to just have a lump of gray rock orbit your head, doing nothing. I'm not your dad.  
- If you don't want a cutpurse snatching yours out of the air, buy a [wayfinder](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3117) and slot the stone in there to reap the benefit without the risk.

## One Last Option for Martial Characters
If you're a martial character and you have more money than you know what to do with, consider literally just giving the extra to a caster. Martial characters would normally spend a lot of their money purchasing *+1 striking* runes for their weapons, but because we're using automatic bonus progress you don't have to--which might leave you flush with cash. Spellcasters having extra wands and scrolls for utility spells helps the entire party, so if you don't know what to do with your extra cash, spellcasters have basically unlimited spending potential.
